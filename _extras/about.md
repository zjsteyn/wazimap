![alt text](https://wazimap.co.za/static/img/wazi-logo.png)   [Wazimap]({{ http://wazimap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ }}) is an online application for exploring census and other similar data. It makes it easy to understand a place through the eyes of the data, and to explore data across a range of places. It is most suited for census data but can easily be used with other data that is similarly focused on places in a country.

Wazimap builds on Censusreporter and makes it easier to re-use. Wazimap was originally built by OpenUp with the support of Media Monitoring Africa. It is maintained by  [OpenUp]({{ https://openup.org.za/ }}).

Some examples include:
- [Wazimap South Africa]({{ https://wazimap.co.za/ }})
- [Hurumap Kenya]({{ https://kenya.hurumap.org/ }})
- [Youth Explorer]({{ https://youthexplorer.org.za/ }})
